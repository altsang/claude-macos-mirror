#!/bin/bash
# coworkctl v7 — move a Cowork workload between two Macs.
#
# SHARED ROOT is configurable. Resolution order:
#   1. $MIRROR_ROOT
#   2. ~/.config/claude-macos-mirror/root   (a file containing the path)
#   3. iCloud Drive default
# It does NOT have to be the same path on both Macs. The stable path is the
# symlink at ~/Documents/Claude/Projects/<Name>, and the Cowork folder grant is
# per-machine anyway -- so Google Drive or Dropbox work even though their paths
# embed an account name.
#
# TRANSPORT: the shared drive only. Deliberately.
#
# v3 also pushed directly over SSH (0.95s, md5-verified) but writing into an
# iCloud-synced folder means TWO writers for one path -- iCloud delivering its
# copy while rsync delivers the same bytes. FileProvider forks rather than
# reconciles, and we observed real conflict copies on both Macs:
# "events 2", "peers 2.conf", "coworkctl-v3 2.sh". One writer only, now.
#
# Consequence you must respect: THIS IS NOT SYNCHRONOUS.
# Measured between these two Macs: ~54s best case, several minutes when the far
# Mac has been asleep, and stalled entirely while it naps. handoff STAGES work.
# Only pickup on the far side proves delivery. Never report staged as delivered.
#
# STATE IS APPEND-ONLY. Every transition writes a NEW event file; nothing is
# rewritten, because iCloud does not reliably propagate an in-place modification
# of a file the peer has already cached. Same reason this script is versioned
# rather than edited: write coworkctl-v5.sh, never edit v4 once it has shipped.
#
# v7: handoff takes --doc, and picks the NEWEST HANDOFF*.md rather than the
# alphabetically first. v6 used `ls HANDOFF*.md | head -1`, so a project with a
# second topic silently attached the wrong document and pickup printed it with
# nothing to indicate the mismatch.
