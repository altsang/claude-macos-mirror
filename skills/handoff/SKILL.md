name: handoff
description: Write the handoff document that lets the user's other Mac (Madoka / Ji-su) continue this work. Use when the user says to hand off, move, send, or continue work on their other machine or laptop, or invokes /handoff by name. Captures everything the receiving machine needs into a self-contained document, then hands the transfer itself to the mirror CLI. Use this instead of improvising a summary, because a local Cowork project cannot sync its chats and the other machine starts with no memory of this conversation.

# Hand off a workload to the other Mac

Al works across two Macs, **Madoka** (desktop) and **Ji-su** (laptop). Shared projects live at one
path identical on both:

```
~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Claude/Projects/PROJECT
```

**Your job is the document, and only the document.** The transfer — materializing files, writing
the manifest, recording ownership, and proving the bytes actually reached iCloud — belongs to
`mirror send`, which runs in a terminal. This session cannot do those things: it is sandboxed to
the project folder and cannot see `fileproviderctl`, the shared `_handoff/` tree, or any CLI. Do
not try, and do not write ownership events yourself; one implementation of the mechanics is the
point.

## Why the document matters more than the bytes

The receiving Mac gets the **files** from the drive automatically. It does **not** get this
conversation, and it cannot: **chat is not available for local Cowork projects**, so there is no
synced history and no project memory to fall back on. Everything you know that isn't written down
is lost at the handoff.

## Step 1 — Identify the project and the target

Project = the folder under the shared `Projects/` tree this session is working in. Target =
whichever of Madoka / Ji-su is not this machine (check device info). Ask only if genuinely
ambiguous.

## Step 2 — Write the document

Write `HANDOFF_TOPIC.md` into the project folder — a new file per topic, named for the topic, not
a generic name. `mirror send` picks the **newest** `HANDOFF*.md`, so an old one left in the folder
is harmless, but a vague name makes it hard to tell them apart later.

Assume a competent agent with zero context who will act on it literally.

```markdown
# HANDOFF — one-line subject

Paste this whole document as your first message in Cowork. It is self-contained.

## Your task
What must be accomplished, concretely, with the actual numbers.

## Before you start — check you actually have access
Prerequisites, each independently verifiable. Say what to do if one is missing —
usually "stop, don't improvise."

## Background — what's wrong and why
The reasoning this session paid for. Include corroborating evidence, and name the
wrong theories explicitly so they don't get re-derived.

## Status
What is DONE and verified, with the figures that prove it. Then a table of what remains.

## Gotchas
Failure modes already hit. Silent ones first.
```

What separates a good handoff from a useless one:

- **Put in the numbers.** "Fix the cost basis" is useless; "THW verified exact at $31,461.60" lets
  the next agent check itself.
- **Record dead ends.** "There are NO return-of-capital transactions in 2026 — do not go looking"
  saves an hour.
- **Mark finished work so it isn't redone.** Repeating a completed financial correction is worse
  than never starting.
- **Name prerequisites honestly.** If the work needs Quicken under Parallels and that lives on one
  machine only, say so at the top, and raise it with the user *before* they transfer.

## Step 3 — Read every file you referenced

iCloud keeps evicted files *dataless*: correct name and size in a listing, contents still in the
cloud, and a read returns empty **with no error**. If you summarized a file you never actually
read, the document is fiction. Read anything you cited, and if a file still reads empty after a
retry, say so in the document rather than papering over it.

## Step 4 — Hand it to the CLI

Tell the user the exact command, with the real project name and target substituted:

```
mirror send "PROJECT" --to MACHINE --note "one line summary" --wait
```

Explain what it will do, because it is the half you cannot do: it materializes the folder, writes
an md5 manifest, records the ownership event naming your document, then **waits until every file
has actually uploaded** — and with `--wait`, until the other Mac claims it.

Then tell them not to edit the project here until it comes back. Two Macs editing one synced folder
is what produces iCloud conflict copies, and the ownership record is what prevents it.

Report honestly: at the moment you finish, the work is **written, not delivered**. Nothing has
left this Mac until `mirror send` says so.
